                The mission of Jewish Student Union is to get more Jewish teens attending public high schools to do something Jewish! That’s
                it! It’s that simple!!! We run more than 200 Jewish culture clubs on public high school campuses. The clubs
                provide Jewish teens with programs that strengthen their Jewish identity and connection to Israel. Since
                the first four clubs were founded in Los Angeles in 2002, JSU has grown quickly and now serves more than
                200 public school campuses across North America, reaching more than 12,000 teens annually. By creating a
                fun, social atmosphere, and bringing cool, Jewish advisors to public school campuses, JSU reaches all types
                of Jewish teenagers. JSU facilitates regular club meetings in public schools that meet during the lunch hour,
                before or after school, providing food for the body and soul. Programs include speakers from a variety of
                Jewish organizations, discussions on timely topics of interest to the participants and interactive activities.
                Kosher pizza, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Starbucks, holiday foods or other snacks are always served. In addition
                to the regularly scheduled school club meetings, JSU sponsors activities outside of school including Retreats,
                Citywide holiday parties, community service projects, ski trips, Friday night dinners, and other exciting
                events. </p>
