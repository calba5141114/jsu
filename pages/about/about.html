        About the Jewish Student Union ?
    </h1> 
    <p>
    The Jewish Student Union is a not only a club but a community. It is a place where Jewish and non-Jewish students 
    can come to discuss current events in the Jewish community in America and Israel. We love to discuss opportunities 
    to volunteer and good ways to help donate time or money to the Jewish community. 
    </p>

    <p>
        At Homestead we have been working with the Jewish Community Center in Palo Alto for opportunities to volunteer. 
        We truly believe in helping the community.
